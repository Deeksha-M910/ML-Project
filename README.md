ML_Project: Analyzing Netflix Content Dynamics

This project aims to leverage a dataset of Netflix shows and movies from 2019 to uncover insights and potentially predict future user preferences. Netflix, the streaming giant captivating millions worldwide, offers a treasure trove of content. This Machine Learning project delves into a 2019 Netflix dataset (from Flixable) to understand user preferences and potentially predict future trends. The data likely includes details like titles, release years, genres, and cast information.

By analyzing this data, we can uncover hidden gems, identify user preferences for specific genres or directors, and potentially improve recommendation algorithms. Even more exciting, the project aims to explore the possibility of predicting future user preferences based on historical data and current trends. This could be invaluable for content creators and Netflix itself in developing or acquiring content that resonates with viewers.

This project is a glimpse into how ML can revolutionize entertainment, allowing platforms to personalize recommendations, curate content libraries effectively, and ultimately keep viewers engaged.
